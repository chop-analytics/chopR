# chopR
This repo contains various materials developed by analysts in the Office of Quality Improvement (OCQI) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia that are used to train new and existing analysts on how to use R. Although these materials have been tailored to the needs of this specific analyst group, they could be useful training materials for other analysts wanting to adopt R, particularly those in a health care setting. 

# What's in this repository?

## Data Viz Guides-Templates
 
This folder contains ggplot and highcharter guides along with a flexdashboard template that is used by OCQI to create R dashboards. You can use these files to being learning how to visualize your data in R and also how to organize this visualizations into a dashboard. 

## Instructional Sessions

This folder contains PDF files of the in-person sessions that all OCQI analysts complete during their R portion of onboarding. The files cover the following topics: CHOP Analytics R Standards, dplyr, lubridate, tidyr, and ggplot. These sessions contain lecture-formatted instructions, examples, and also practice exercises using a dummy dataset. 

## Standards

This folder contains documentation related to CHOP Analytics R Standards that all analysts are recommended to adhere to in order to allow for ffective and efficient code review, project handoff, and project sustainment. The standards cover the following topics: querying philosophy, organization, code structure, and code style for projects using R scripts and R markdowns.

# Who created this repository?

The materials contained in this repository were developed and are maintained by members of the R Adoption team within the OCQI at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Below is the problem statement, mission statement, and goal that this team had in mind when developing these materials. 

## Problem Statment

Despite its many advantages, R is not a widely used tool within OCQI due to lack of analysts' understanding of practical value of R, OCQI R standards, R templates, and comprehensive training to adopt the tool. 

## Mission

Identify the gaps in R adoption, generate excitement around this tool, and create the necessary materials and trainings so that analysts can use this tool in their relevant day to day work

## Goals

This group aimed to address four primary goals with these materials: 
1. Establish OCQI R Standards
2. Develop data visualization guides and templates
3. Create training materials to teach the OCQI "standard packages"
4. Generate excitement around R
